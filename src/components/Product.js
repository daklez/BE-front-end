            <h1>Equity Zero</h1>
            <h2>"A unique opportunity in the world of investments designed to offer both security and profitability."</h2>
            <h2>Our Strategy:</h2>
            <p>When you invest in our product, 50% of your investment goes into a fixed-income fund, while the other 50% 
                is leveraged X2 to generate returns as if you were investing 100% of your funds. If you experience losses, 
                the capital in the fixed-income fund will recover 100% of your long-term investment to minimize your loss to ZERO.</p>
            <h3>Focus</h3>
            <p>We are a hedge fund operating with a clear vision: to provide an investment experience that is both safe and profitable.</p>
            <h3>Objectivity</h3>
            <p>We understand the challenges investors face in the stock market and seek to provide a solution to mitigate those risks.</p>
            <h3>Integrity</h3>
            <p>We operate on a transparent and ethical model. Your investment is treated with care and responsibility; choose the strategy 
                that best suits your goals.</p>
            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <h3>Market</h3>
            <p>You can trade in the stock market, as it is highly liquid, less volatile, and less manipulated. These characteristics make 
                it a safer option for all parties involved.</p>
            <h3>Contributions</h3>
            <p>You can make contributions to your investment, where 50% of these contributions will always go to the fixed fund. 
                This is because our priority is to preserve your capital, while yours is to increase it.</p>
            <h3>Fixed-Income Fund</h3>
            <p>The fixed-income fund, where 50% of your capital is allocated, generates a fixed monthly compounded return of 4%. 
                This means that if you happen to lose the other 50% when investing in stocks, it will take the fund a little over a year 
                to recover 100% of your investment to cover your losses to 0.</p>
            <h3>Operations</h3>
            <p>The type of operations you can carry out will be limited to buying only, as selling involves a higher risk without a loss 
                limit if the operation goes against you.</p>
            <h3>Derivatives</h3>
            <p>The financial instrument you operate with on our platform is stock derivatives. These derivatives are financial contracts 
                whose value is tied to the price of an underlying stock but do not imply direct ownership of the stock itself.</p>
            <h3>Minimum Amount</h3>
            <p>You can invest in our fund from $100 USD. Please consider the associated fees for international transfers, as you must 
                deposit your funds into our US bank account.</p>
            <h3>Adjustments</h3>
            <p>The primary purpose of the fixed fund is to preserve the initial capital; therefore, it is not necessary to partition 50% 
                each time the capital increases or decreases.</p>
            <h3>Leverage</h3>
            <p>50% of your capital will be leveraged at a ratio of x2. This means you will experience gains and losses as if you were 
                investing 100% of your capital. It's important to understand that this leverage does not increase your buying power but 
                extends the possibility of getting double gains or losses.</p>
            <h3>Withdrawals</h3>
            <p>You can make partial or full withdrawals of your investment. However, after the withdrawal, the remaining amount must 
                ensure that at least 50% stays in the fixed fund to guarantee risk coverage. In case of losses, we recommend NOT 
                withdrawing the funds to allow the possibility of recovering your investment.</p>
