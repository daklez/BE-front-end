        We employ teams of specialists who are experts in analyzing corporate stocks and determining the impact of the action on a company's stock price.
        
        This analysis includes, among other things, a look at the current regulatory environment, potential mergers or acquisitions synergies, and a new target price after the action has been completed.`

        One of the key advantages of a quantitative investment strategy is that the model, and ultimately the systems, make the actual buying/selling decisions, not a human being.
        
        This tends to eliminate any emotional response that a person may experience when buying or selling financial assets.`
